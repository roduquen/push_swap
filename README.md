Projet 42 Push_Swap

The haim of this project is to sort a list by using only a few moves and only on 2 differents lists :
- Swap the first elem and the second of a list, or twice
- Rotate the first elem to the last of a list
- Rotate the last elem to the first of a list
- Push the first elem to the other list.

Sorting choice : insertion sort, optimized with no backtracking only the best move for each turn is found.
